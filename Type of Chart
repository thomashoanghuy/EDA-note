When performing bivariate or multivariate correlation between predictors variable vs target variables, these are tips to consider 
  1. Numerical vs. Numerical Data
      Goal: Examine relationships between two or more continuous variables.
      Types of Charts:
          Scatter Plot:
            Ideal for visualizing relationships between two numerical variables.
            Add a regression line if you want to emphasize the trend.
          Pair Plot (Seaborn pairplot):
            Visualizes relationships across all numerical variables in a dataset, including histograms for univariate analysis.
          Heatmap of Correlation Matrix:
            Useful for many numerical variables.
            Displays Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients as color intensities.
          Bubble Chart:
            Adds a third numerical dimension by using bubble size.
  2. Numerical vs. Categorical Data
      Goal: Explore how a numerical variable varies across categories.
       Types of Charts:
          Box Plot:
            Shows distribution, median, and variability for a numerical variable across categories.
          Violin Plot:
            Combines a box plot with a kernel density plot for a richer view of distributions.
          Bar Plot (with Aggregates):
            Summarizes numerical data (e.g., mean or median) for each category.
          Strip Plot / Swarm Plot:
            Displays all data points for each category, highlighting individual observations.
  3. Categorical vs. Categorical Data
        Goal: Analyze relationships between two categorical variables.
       Types of Charts:
          Stacked Bar Chart:
            Shows the composition of one category within another.
          Mosaic Plot:
            Visualizes proportions of one category against another.
          Heatmap (with counts):
            Displays frequency or proportions as a grid, with categories on the axes.
          Grouped Bar Chart:
              Useful for side-by-side comparisons of category counts.

    4. Multivariate Analysis
      Goal: Explore interactions among more than two variables.
      Charts:
        Heatmap:
          For correlation matrices involving multiple variables.
        3D Scatter Plot:
          Ideal for visualizing relationships among three numerical variables.
        Facet Grid (Seaborn FacetGrid):
          Plots multiple small graphs based on one or more categorical variables.
        Parallel Coordinates Plot:
          Visualizes trends in multivariate numerical data.
        Radar Chart (Spider Plot):
          Compares multiple numerical variables for different categories.
        Clustered Heatmap:
          Combines hierarchical clustering and heatmaps for groups of variables.

Key Considerations for Chart Selection
Data Type: Match the chart to the types of variables (categorical, numerical).
Purpose:
Show relationships? Use scatter plots or correlation heatmaps.
Compare distributions? Use box plots or violin plots.
Explore composition? Use stacked bar or mosaic plots.
Data Volume:
Large datasets may need aggregation (e.g., heatmaps).
Readability:
Avoid overcrowding by limiting variables per chart.
